 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent system to detect and classify SMS messages as either Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using various machine learning algorithms. It leverages text preprocessing techniques and a diverse set of supervised learning models to achieve accurate and scalable results.

 Key Features

✅ Real-time SMS spam detection

✅ Preprocessed text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

✅ Trained on multiple models for comparative analysis

✅ Achieved high accuracy with ensemble models
